### [_Repository on GitHub_](https://github.com/Juanjjs/Google-Street-View)

This project serves as a guide for integrating Google Street View within an Android application using Android Studio and the Google Maps API. It is particularly useful in applications requiring navigation or visual location presentation, such as tourism, real estate, or transportation, as it allows for specific locations to be viewed in street view.

---

## Technical Description

### 1. **Configuration in Android Studio**

   Development was done in **Java** and is compatible with current Android versions. When cloning the repository, make sure to follow these steps for a successful setup:

   - **`MainActivity.java`**: This is the main class that manages both the map loading and street view. Here, the Street View API events are configured, and the interface is updated based on interactions.
   - **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: Adding the `API Key` in the manifest file is mandatory to access Google Maps services. Without this step, the map and Street View will not work in the application.
   - **`gradle.build`**: The Gradle file includes all essential dependencies and ensures that the project compiles correctly across different Android versions.

   > **Important Note:** You should ensure that the API key is restricted to specific applications and domains to prevent security issues and misuse.

### 2. **Using the Google Maps and Street View API**

   Integrating Google Maps and Street View requires enabling both the **Google Maps SDK for Android** and the **Street View API** in the Google Cloud Console. Once the API key is configured, you can use the following code to initialize Street View at the desired location:

   ```java
   StreetViewPanoramaView streetViewPanoramaView = findViewById(R.id.street_view_panorama);
   streetViewPanoramaView.getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(new OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback() {
       @Override
       public void onStreetViewPanoramaReady(StreetViewPanorama streetViewPanorama) {
           streetViewPanorama.setPosition(new LatLng(-33.87365, 151.20689)); // Example coordinates
           streetViewPanorama.setZoomGesturesEnabled(true);  // Enable zoom gestures
           streetViewPanorama.setUserNavigationEnabled(true); // Enable user navigation
       }
   });
   ```

   #### Additional Details:
   - **User Gestures**: The API allows enabling or disabling user gestures such as zoom, rotation, and navigation, providing a fully interactive experience.
   - **Camera Events**: You can handle Street View camera events to dynamically update the view based on the specified coordinates or direction.

### 3. **Interface Control and Visual Configuration**

   Street View can be adjusted to display specific locations and views by controlling angle, tilt, and zoom. This helps to tailor the visual experience for the user, centering it on the required location or point of interest.

   - **Viewing Angle (Bearing)**: Controls the viewing angle based on camera orientation.
   - **Tilt**: Defines the tilt angle, useful for viewing building facades or landscapes.
   - **Zoom**: You can set the zoom level to focus on specific areas, using the `zoomIn()` and `zoomOut()` methods for programmatic interaction.

   ```java
   streetViewPanorama.setPosition(new LatLng(-33.87365, 151.20689));
   streetViewPanorama.animateTo(
       new StreetViewPanoramaCamera.Builder()
           .bearing(180)   // Set the viewing angle
           .tilt(30)       // Set the tilt
           .zoom(2)        // Zoom level
           .build(), 
       5000  // Animation duration in milliseconds
   );
   ```

### 4. **Gradle Dependencies and Configuration**

   Gradle configuration ensures the integration of all necessary dependencies. Be sure to add and synchronize the following block in `build.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:17.0.0'
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0'
   ```

   These packages allow the use of the Google Maps API and real-time location services, which is especially useful if you want to center the street view on the user’s current location.

   > **Note:** It is recommended to specify the versions of Google Play services to avoid compatibility conflicts on different devices.

### 5. **Location Permissions**

   For a complete user experience, especially in navigation applications, the app can request location permissions using the following code in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
   ```

   At runtime, use the `FusedLocationProviderClient` class to get the user’s location and center Street View on that position.

### 6. **Integration with the Application Lifecycle**

   Street View integration should be managed in each stage of the Android lifecycle to improve performance. For example:

   ```java
   @Override
   protected void onStart() {
       super.onStart();
       streetViewPanoramaView.onStart();
   }

   @Override
   protected void onStop() {
       super.onStop();
       streetViewPanoramaView.onStop();
   }
   ```

   This prevents the map from continuing to load unnecessarily, optimizing the app’s resources.

## Implementation and Customization

The implementation of this project follows Android development best practices. You can clone the repository, add your API key, and adjust the coordinates or visual parameters to create a rich user experience. The project’s structure allows each component to function modularly, making customization easy to meet the needs of each application.
